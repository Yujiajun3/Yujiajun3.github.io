Hi! I am currently pursuing a master's degree in the [FastLab](http://zju-fast.com/) (Fire Group) at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, under the guidance of [Yanjun Cao](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/yanjun-cao/) and [Chao Xu](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/chao-xu/).

My current focus is on utilizing deep reinforcement learning to enhance traditional optimization methods.
If you're interested in discussing my work or potential collaborations, feel free to email me at jjyu@zju.edu.cn.
